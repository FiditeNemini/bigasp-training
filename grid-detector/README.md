# Grid Detector

Dump of the code and notebooks for manually annotating images as "grid" or "not grid", and training a model based on that.  This is raw, messy code. Caveat emptor.


"Grid" images were images in my dataset like video thumbnail previews, etc.  These really messed with SDXL training, so this helped to weed them all out.
