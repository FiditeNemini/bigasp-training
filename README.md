# bigasp-training
Various training scripts used to train bigasp.  This code is dropped here as-is, in case it is of any use. There's no guarantee that it's _correct_.  But it "works", in the sense that it was able to trained bigASP.  So *shrug*.  Caveat emptor.

bigASP v1 code: https://github.com/fpgaminer/bigasp-training/tree/bigasp-v1
bigASP v2 code (current): https://github.com/fpgaminer/bigasp-training/tree/bigasp-v2


## v2.5
bigASP v2.5 was trained using this exact script: https://github.com/fpgaminer/bigasp-training/blob/08bc9ba902dc0bacc389ade27da101fc36bc6f85/v2_5/mosaic-train.py
And this config: https://github.com/fpgaminer/bigasp-training/blob/2fdfd108892b68b3a62e50015141cf9a4a551a33/v2_5/mosaic-config.yaml
It has been committed as-is for posterity, but it is filled to the brim with hacks, workarounds, debugging, etc.
